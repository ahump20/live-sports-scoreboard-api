# Live Sports Scoreboard API

## Description
A simple API build with Node.js and Express and containerized using Docker. It is one component of a project I have worked on using an Adafruit Matrix Portal. In short, it is an LED scoreboard that can show live up-to-the-minute scores for the MLB and NFL. This is the API that is called by the scoreboard to get the live score data.

At the moment, all of the backend infrastructure required for it is hosted on GCP. My goal is to self-host everything on my Raspberry Pi. As a side objective, I also want to document everything I build and add it to my Github.
